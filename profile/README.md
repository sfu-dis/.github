#### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

We work on transactional and analytical systems on modern hardware, new programming paradigms and support for emerging applications. We also contribute to related areas such as synchronization, operating systems and distributed systems while solving database systems problems. 

Our work consistently appears in top-tier database conferences (VLDB/SIGMOD/CIDR) and is being picked up by industry partners. For example:
- [DragonflyDB](https://dragonflydb.io/)'s core hash table structure is based on Dash [[VLDB 2020](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol13/p1147-lu.pdf)][[SIGMOD Record 2021](https://sigmodrecord.org/publications/sigmodRecord/2103/pdfs/22_sdh-lu.pdf)].
- [Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/redshift/) adopted the Serial Safety Net [[VLDBJ 2017](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00778-017-0463-8)][[DaMoN 2015](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2771937.2771949)] to support serializability.

Our lab is also home to a series of open-source research prototypes that received major awards (e.g., [ACM SIGMOD Research Highlights](https://sigmod.org/sigmod-awards/sigmod-research-highlights/) 2021, 2023) and are being used by our peers, e.g., [CoroBase](https://github.com/sfu-dis/corobase), [PiBench](https://github.com/sfu-dis/pibench), [ERMIA](https://github.com/sfu-dis/ermia), [PMwCAS](https://github.com/microsoft/pmwcas) and implementations of [concurrent persistent memory indexes](https://github.com/sfu-dis/pibench-ep2). All of our work is open-source - check out the [repositories](https://github.com/orgs/sfu-dis/repositories) page to learn more! 

We are part of the [Data Science Research Group](https://data.cs.sfu.ca) in the [School of Computing Science](https://www.sfu.ca/computing.html) at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/) in [Metro Vancouver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Vancouver), Canada.
