### ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

We work on research problems in data management, especailly database systems on modern hardware, novel programming environments and emerging applications. Our current projects focus on problems in transactional and analytical systems for persistent memory, next-generation storage devices, massively parallel processors and fast networks. We also contribute to related areas such as synchornization, operating systems and distributed systems while solving database systems problems.

Our lab is home to a series of open-source research prototypes being used by our peers, e.g., [PiBench](https://github.com/sfu-dis/pibench), [ERMIA](https://github.com/sfu-dis/ermia), [PMwCAS](https://github.com/microsoft/pmwcas) and implementations of [concurrent persistent memory indexes](https://github.com/sfu-dis/pibench-ep2). All of our work is open-source - check out the [repositories](https://github.com/orgs/sfu-dis/repositories) page to learn more! 

We are part of the [Data Science Research Group](https://data.cs.sfu.ca) in the [School of Computing Science](https://www.sfu.ca/computing.html) at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/) in [Metro Vancouver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Vancouver), Canada.
